# code-faster
"Code faster" is an Single Page Application project made with Vue.js

It allows you to do some typing texts in
a more playful way, racing a "match" against an opponent until you face the final dot, forcing a faster writting and obtaining with consistent practice better results, both in speed and precision.

## How it works

The app is really intuitive. By the way, if you have any problem, I have written a little review in my [personal blog](http://projects.gtamani.com/posts/type-faster/) (Disclaimer: written in spanish) explaining how it works.
